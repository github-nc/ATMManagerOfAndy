Rules of password management:



To reduce the possibilities of mistaken typing from command line for testing my project, I think it is better to clarify the things below :

(1) My program will add 1 admin user and 2 client users as you required once it gets launched, but only the client users' accounts are editable later.

(2) To simplify my program,  "admin (ID = 0001, PIN = 012345)" is the only administrator account which can't be edited and deleted after its birth.

      No more other administrator user(s) could be added.

(3) Of course any client user(s) including the 2 testing clients could be added and deleted.

(4) For adding a new client user, a client account requests 6 digits inside [0-9] for passcode and 2 leading English letters inside [a-zA-Z] for username.
